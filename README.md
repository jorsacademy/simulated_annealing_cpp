# Simulated Annealing Example in C++

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm to find the minimum of the function f(x) = x^2.

## How to Run
To compile and run this project, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ -o simulated_annealing cpp_sa.cpp
./simulated_annealing


Algorithm Explanation
Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global minimum of a given function. It simulates the physical process of heating a material and then slowly lowering the temperature to decrease defects, thus minimizing the system energy.
